A microservice for scheduling jobs part of the link:https://github.com/restorecommerce[Restorecommerce].

[#features]
== Features

* Scheduling of jobs in a cron like manner.
* Three kinds of jobs can be scheduled: `immediate jobs`, `one-time future jobs` and `recurring jobs`.
* Job scheduling is implemented using link:https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull[bull] backed by link:https://redis.io/[Redis].
* Concurrency and rate limiting for job processing. The job processing is made
by matching the Job type with the Queue name.
In the case when there is no match the jobs are being added to the default Queue.

[#configuration]
== Configuration

* This service will hook any modules that are placed in the
link:https://github.com/restorecommerce/scheduling-srv/tree/master/src/external-jobs[external-jobs] directory.
Use this to execute jobs on the scheduling-srv itself.
* The rescheduling of missed recurring jobs on service start up can be disabled
in the https://github.com/restorecommerce/scheduling-srv/blob/master/cfg/config.json#L344[configuration].
* Queues can be configured to use
https://github.com/restorecommerce/scheduling-srv/blob/master/cfg/config.json#L342[concurrency]
and https://github.com/restorecommerce/scheduling-srv/blob/master/test/cfg/config_test.json#L335[rate limiting]
for job processing, where `max` is the maximum number of jobs processed, per `duration` in milliseconds.
* `authorization:enable`: default value is `true`, if set to `true` then access-control check is performed, if value is set to `false` then access-control check is overridden.
* `authorization:enforce`: default value is `true`, if set to `true` then result of access-control-check is enforced, if value is set to `false` the result of access-control check if logged and ignored.

[#api_scheduling_crud]
==== CRUD Operations

The microservice exposes the below CRUD operations for creating or modifying Job resources.

`io.restorecommerce.job.Service`

[width="100%",cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===============================================================================
| Method Name | Request Type | Response Type | Description
| Create | `io.restorecommerce.job.JobList` | `io.restorecommerce.job.JobList` | Create a list of Job resources.
| Read | `io.restorecommerce.job.JobReadRequest` | `io.restorecommerce.job.JobList` | Read a list of Job resources.
| Update | `io.restorecommerce.job.JobList` | `io.restorecommerce.job.JobList` | Update a list of Job resources.
| Delete | `io.restorecommerce.resourcebase.DeleteRequest` | https://github.com/restorecommerce/protos/blob/master/google/protobuf/empty.proto[`google.protobuf.Empty`] | Delete a list of Job resources.
|===============================================================================

[#api_job_create]
=== `Create`

Used to create list of Job resources. Requests are performed providing `io.restorecommerce.job.JobList` protobuf message as
input and responses are `io.restorecommerce.job.JobList` message. If job id is provided then it is used for job identifier (should be unique), if not then an uuid is generated from this service.
For repeatable Jobs `Bull` has an internal mechanism to generate job id, it generates the repeatable key based on the job id and cron settings. To map the repeatable key to job identifier
exposed from this service `Redis` is used with  https://github.com/restorecommerce/scheduling-srv/blob/master/cfg/config.json#L12[configurable DB index] to store the key value pair.

[#api_job_Read]
=== `Read`

Used to read list of Job resources. Requests are performed providing `io.restorecommerce.job.JobReadRequest` protobuf message as
input and responses are `io.restorecommerce.job.JobList` message. This operation supports job filter using job ids or job types.
If no job filter is provided then all jobs in redis with job state completed, failed, active, inactive jobs in redis are returned.
For the detailed protobuf message structure of `io.restorecommerce.job.ReadRequest` refer link:https://github.com/restorecommerce/protos/blob/master/io/restorecommerce/job.proto[job.proto].

`io.restorecommerce.job.JobReadRequest`

[width="100%",cols="20%,16%,20%,44%",options="header",]
|===============================================================================
| Field | Type | Label | Description
| sort  | `io.restorecommerce.job.SortOrder` | optional | sort order
| filter| `io.restorecommerce.job.JobFilter` | optional | job filter
| field | https://github.com/restorecommerce/protos/blob/master/io/restorecommerce/resource_base.proto[`io.restorecommerce.resourcebase.FieldFilter`] | field filter
|subject |`io.restorecommerce.auth.Subject` |required |Subject details
|===============================================================================

`io.restorecommerce.job.SortOrder`

[width="100%",cols="20%,16%,20%,44%",options="header",]
|===============================================================================
| Field | Type | Label | Description
| UNSORTED | ENUM | optional | unsorted order
| ASCENDING  | ENUM | optional | ascending order
| DESCENDING| ENUM | optional | descending order
|===============================================================================

`io.restorecommerce.job.JobFilter`

[width="100%",cols="20%,16%,20%,44%",options="header",]
|===============================================================================
| Field | Type | Label | Description
| job_ids | string [] | optional | list of job identifiers
| type  | string | optional | job type
|===============================================================================

[#api_job_Update]
=== `Update`

Used to update list of Job resources. Requests are performed providing `io.restorecommerce.job.JobList` protobuf message as
input and responses are `io.restorecommerce.job.JobList` message. Since `Bull` does not internally provide an update operation,
this operation deletes an existing job and reschedules it with new data. It is possible to update the cron settings and other job
options as well for recurring job based on the job-id. In this case although the repeatable key maintained by Bull is changed the
job id exposed from this service remains the same (since this service maintains a mapping between job id and repeatable key).

[#api_job_Upsert]
=== `Upsert`

Used to upsert list of Job resources. Requests are performed providing `io.restorecommerce.job.JobList` protobuf message as
input and responses are `io.restorecommerce.job.JobList` message. If job does not exist then a new job is created.
If job already exists with given job id, then it is deleted, and a new job is created with provided data, but the job identifier remains the same.

[#api_job_Delete]
=== `Delete`

Used to delete list of Job resources. Requests are performed providing `io.restorecommerce.resourcebase.DeleteRequest` protobuf message as
input and responses are a `google.protobuf.Empty` message. This operation supports passing a list of job identifiers `ids` to delete,
it also exposes boolean param `collection` and if set to true all  the jobs in Redis data would be deleted. For the detailed protobuf message structure
of`io.restorecommerce.job.DeleteRequest` refer link:https://github.com/restorecommerce/protos/blob/master/io/restorecommerce/job.proto[job.proto].

| Field | Type | Label | Description
| id | number | required | Job instance ID in redis.
| schedule_type | string | required | Job type ex: `ONCE`, `RECURR` etc.
| error | string | required | Failure details.
|===============================================================================

Events from the `io.restorecommerce.jobs` topic are issued whenever a CRUD operation is performed.
They are useful for rescheduling of jobs in case of Redis failure.

Jobs emitted by this service to Kafka can be consumed by other microservices by listening to the `queuedJob` event.
After processing the job an event should be emitted by the respective microservice indicating job failure or completion.
A job is always deleted upon being receiving failure or completion data, unless it is a recurring job.
